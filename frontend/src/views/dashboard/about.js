              Life without good health is like an army without soldiers and chocolate without cocoa. Health is important to live life to the fullest.

              When a person leads a healthy lifestyle, the body remains healthy and the mind is active and fresh.

              Living a healthy life would extend longevity and also regenerate the body and mind.

              Having good health is of core importance to human happiness.          </p>
